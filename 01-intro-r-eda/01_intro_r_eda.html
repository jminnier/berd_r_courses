# Introduction

Rrrrrr?

---

# What is R? 

.pull-left-60[
- A programming language
- Focus on statistical modeling and data analysis
    + import data, manipulate data, run statistics, make plots
- Useful for "Data Science"
- Great visualizations
- Also useful for most anything else you'd want to tell a computer to do
- Interfaces with other languages i.e. python, C++, bash

]


.pull-right-40[
![](img/R_logo.png)
]


For the history and details: [Wikipedia](https://bit.ly/1efFmaY)

- an interpreted language (run it through a command line)
- procedural programming with functions
- Why "R"?? Scheme (?) inspired S (invented at Bell Labs in 1976) which inspired R (**free and open source!** in 1992)

---

# Why R?
.pull-left[
- Free + Cross-platform (Mac/Windows)
- Flexible, fun, many more modern statistics methods, large community for learning and help
- One of the most popular data science tools for statistics in academia and industry
- SAS and STATA (and SPSS) are still used but becoming less popular (expensive, not as versatile/comprehensive)
- Constantly evolving and improving
- If you want a job doing stats and not be limited to specific research groups or some pharma companies, you absolutely *need to know R*

# Coding in the console 
 
.pull-left[
When you first open R, the console should be empty.

&lt;img src="img/01_console_empty.png" width="90%" height="100%"&gt;

]


.pull-right[
__Typing and executing code in the console __
* Type code in the console (blue text)
* Press __return__ to execute the code
* Output shown below in black

# Variables

Variables are used to store data, figures, model output, etc.
.pull-left[
* Can assign a variable using either `=` or `&lt;-`
    - Using `&lt;-` is preferable
    - type name of variable to print
    

Assign just one value:

```r
&gt; x = 5
&gt; x
```

```
[1] 5
```

```r
&gt; x &lt;- 5
&gt; x
```

```
[1] 5
```
]

--

.pull-right[
Assign a __vector__ of values:
* Consecutive integers using `:`


```r
&gt; a &lt;- 3:10
&gt; a
```

```
[1]  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10

# Using functions

* `mean()` is an example of a function
* functions have "arguments" that are specified within the `()`

# Viewing list of defined variables

 
&lt;!-- __List of defined variables (and other objects)__ --&gt;

* `ls()` is the R command to see what objects have been defined. 
* This list includes all defined objects (including dataframes, functions, etc.)

```r
&gt; ls()
```

```
[1] "a"         "b"         "greetings" "hi"        "x"         "y"        
```

* You can also look at the list in the Environment window:

![](img/01_ls_screenshot.png)

---

# Removing defined variables


* The R command to delete an object is `rm()`. 


```r
&gt; ls()
```

```
[1] "a"         "b"         "greetings" "hi"        "x"         "y"        
```

```r
&gt; rm("greetings", hi)  # Can run with or without quotes
&gt; ls()
```

```
[1] "a" "b" "x" "y"
```

* Remove EVERYTHING - _Be careful!!_

```r
&gt; rm(list=ls())
&gt; ls()
```

```
character(0)
```
 
 * Can also remove everything using the _Clear Workspace_ option in the _Session_ menu.

# Common console errors (1/2)
 
__Incomplete commands__ 

.pull-left[
* When the console is waiting for a new command, the prompt line begins with `&gt;`
  + If the console prompt is `+`, then a previous command is incomplete
  + You can finish typing the command in the console window
]
   
.pull-right[
Example:


```r
&gt; 3 + (2*6
+ )
```

```
[1] 15
```
]



---

# Common console errors (2/2)


__Object is not found__

* This happens when text is entered for a non-existent variable (object)

Example:


```r
&gt; hello
```

```
Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'hello' not found
```

* Can be due to missing quotes


```r
&gt; install.packages(dplyr) # need install.packages("dplyr")
```

```
Error in install.packages(dplyr): object 'dplyr' not found
```


---

# R Projects (.Rproj file) &amp; Good Practices

__Use projects to keep everything together__ ([read this](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html))
- A project keeps track of your coding environment and file structure.
- Create an RStudio project for each data analysis project, for each homework assignment, etc.
- A project is associated with a directory folder
    + Keep data files there
    + Keep code scripts there; edit them, run them in bits or as a whole
    + Save your outputs (plots and cleaned data) there
- Only use relative paths, never absolute paths
    + relative (good): `read.csv("data/mydata.csv")`
    + absolute (bad): `read.csv("/home/yourname/Documents/stuff/mydata.csv")`
    
__Advantages of using projects__
- standardizes file paths
- keep everything together
- a whole folder can be easily shared and run on another computer
- when you open the project everything is as you left it

#  Create an R Markdown file (`.Rmd`) 

&lt;!-- * Note that both of these options show the keyboard shortcut for your operating system   --&gt;
    
Two options:
1. click on File `\(\rightarrow\)` New File `\(\rightarrow\)` R Markdown `\(\rightarrow\)` OK , or
1. in upper left corner of RStudio click on &lt;img src="img/green_plus_create_file.png"&gt;  `\(\rightarrow\)` &lt;img src="img/select_RMarkdown_option.png"&gt;

.pull-left[

# Save the Markdown file (`.Rmd`)

* __Save the file__ by 
    + selecting `File -&gt; Save`, 
    + or clicking on ![](img/01_Script_Save.png) (towards the left above the scripting window),
    + or keyboard shortcut
        * PC:   _Ctrl + s_
        * Mac:   _Command + s_
        

* You will need to specify
    + a __filename__ to save the file as
        - ALWAYS use __.Rmd__ as the filename extension for R markdown files
    + the __folder__ to save the file in

---

# How to create the html file? _Knit_ the .Rmd file! 

&lt;!-- *Before knitting the .Rmd file, you must first **save it**. * --&gt;

To **knit** the .Rmd file, either
1. click on the knit icon &lt;img src="img/knit_icon.png"&gt; at the top of the editor window 
1. or use keyboard shortcuts
    * Mac: *Command+Shift+K* 
    * PC:  *Ctrl+Shift+K*

* A new window will open with the html output.
* You will now see both .Rmd and .html files in the folder where you saved the .Rmd file.

__Remarks:__
* The template .Rmd file that RStudio creates will knit to an html file by default
* Watch the [Reproducible Reports with R Markdown](https://github.com/jminnier/berd_r_courses) workshop for more customization and output formats (Word, pdf, slides).

# Practice 1

1. Create a new Rmd file and type the code and answers for tasks below in it. Save as `Practice1.Rmd`

1. Remove any template text you don't need (starting with line 12), and create a new code chunk.

1. Create a vector of all integers from 4 to 10, and save it as `a1`. 

1. Create a vector of _even_ integers from 4 to 10, and save it as `a2`. 

1. What do you get when you add `a1` to `a2`? 

1. What does the command `sum(a1)` do?

1. What does the command `length(a1)` do?

1. Use the `sum` and `length` commands to calculate the average of the values in `a1`.

1. Knit the Rmd file.

1. Take a break!

# Intro to Data

---

# How is data stored, how do we use it?

- Often, data is in an excel sheet, or a plain text file (.csv, .txt)
- .csv files open in Excel automatically, but actually are plain text
- Usually, columns are variables/measures and rows are observations (i.e. a person's measurements)

**Open the data file `yrbss.csv` and look at it**

**Move the data file `yrbss.csv` into the Rstudio project folder** 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="img/01_filestruc.png" width="87%" height="70%"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

---

# Data in R/Rstudio

**Open `yrbss.csv` in Rstudio and look at it**

- Click on `yrbss.csv` in the Files pane, click *View File*
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="img/01_filestruc2.png" width="87%" height="70%"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

**We will show you how to store and use this data in R as a data frame**
 
---

# First, load the packages we need

We will be using functions within the `tidyverse` package in R.

- In the console, run the installation code
  + if you get a message about restarting R, click Yes
  + if you get an error message IN RED (warnings in orange or black text are ok), ask a TA


```r
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("janitor")
```

- Then add this code to the setup chunk in the Rmd and run that chunk:

.pull-left[

```r
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
```
]
.pull-right[
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="img/rmd_library.png" width="87%" height="70%"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
]

- Now we can use functions in these packages, such as `read_csv()` and `%&gt;%` and `mutate()` and `tabyl()`

# Data frames (aka "tibbles" in tidyverse)

.pull-left-60[
__Vectors__ vs. __data frames__: a data frame is a collection (or array or table) of vectors


```r
df &lt;- tibble(
  IDs=1:3, 
  gender=c("male", "female", "Male"), 
  age=c(28, 35.5, 31),
  trt = c("control", "1", "1"),
  Veteran = c(FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)

.pull-right-40[

* Allows different columns to be of different data types (i.e. numeric vs. text)
* Both numeric and text can be stored within a column (stored together as *text*).

* Vectors and data frames are examples of _**objects**_ in R. 
  + There are other types of R objects to store data, such as matrices, lists.
  + These will be discussed in future R workshops.

# `filter()` practice

What do these commands do? Try them out:


```r
mydata %&gt;% filter(age == "14 years old")
mydata %&gt;% filter(bmi/weight_kg &lt; 0.5)    # can do math
mydata %&gt;% filter((bmi &lt; 15) | (bmi &gt; 25))
mydata %&gt;% filter(bmi &lt; 20, weight_kg &lt; 60, sex == "Female") # filter on multiple variables

mydata %&gt;% filter(id == 923122)      # note the use of == instead of just =
mydata %&gt;% filter(sex == "Female")
mydata %&gt;% filter(!(grade == "9th"))
mydata %&gt;% filter(grade %in% c("10th", "11th"))

mydata %&gt;% filter(is.na(bmi))

# `select()` `\(\sim\)` columns

- select columns (variables)
- no quotes needed around variable names
- can be used to rearrange columns
- uses special syntax that is flexible and has many options


```r

```

```
## # A tibble: 20 x 2

# Column selection syntax options

There are many ways to select a set of variable names (columns):

- `var1:var20`: all columns from `var1` to `var20`
- `one_of(c("a", "b", "c"))`: all columns with names in the specified character vector of names
- __Removing columns__
    + `-var1`: remove the column`var1`
    + `-(var1:var20)`: remove all columns from `var1` to `var20`
- __Select using text within column names__
    + `contains("date")`, `contains("_")`: all variable names that contain the specified string
    + `starts_with("a")` or `ends_with("last")`: all variable names that start or end with the specificed string
- __Rearranging columns__
    + use `everything()` to select all columns not already named
    + example: `select(var1, var20, everything())` moves the column `var20` to the second position

See other examples in the [data wrangling cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf).

# `select()` practice

Which columns are selected &amp; in what order using these commands?  
First guess and then try them out.


```r
mydata %&gt;% select(id:sex)
mydata %&gt;% select(one_of(c("age","weight_kg")))

mydata %&gt;% select(-grade,-sex)
mydata %&gt;% select(-(id:sex))

mydata %&gt;% select(contains("race"))
mydata %&gt;% select(starts_with("r"))
mydata %&gt;% select(-contains("r"))

mydata %&gt;% select(id, race4, everything())

# `mutate()` practice

What do the following commands do?  
First guess and then try them out.


```r
mydata %&gt;% mutate(bmi_high = (bmi &gt; 30))

mydata %&gt;% mutate(male = (sex == "Male"))
mydata %&gt;% mutate(male = 1 * (sex == "Male"))

mydata %&gt;% mutate(grade_num = as.numeric(str_remove(grade, "th")))
```


---

# Practice 2

1. Create a new Rmd or continue in your current Rmd.

1. Create data frames for males and females separately.

1. Do males and females have similar BMIs? Weights? Compares means, standard deviations, range, and boxplots.

1. Plot BMI vs. weight for each gender separately. Do they have similar relationships?

1. Are males or females more likely to be bullied in the past 12 months? Calculate the percentage bullied for each gender.



---

# Save data frame

* Save __.RData__ file: the standard R format, which is recommended if saving data for future use in R

```r
save(mydata, file = "data/mydata.RData")  # saving mydata within the data folder
```

You can load .RData files using the load() command:


```r
load("data/mydata.RData")
```
  

&lt;br&gt;

* Save __csv__ file: comma-separated values


```r
write.csv(mydata, file = "data/mydata.csv", col.names = TRUE, row.names = FALSE)
```

- We can summarize data as a whole, or in groups with `group_by()`

- Notice `grade` is not sorted in a pleasing way. We will learn how to deal with this when we discuss `factors` as a data type in R.
- Base R has a `table` function, but it is clunkier and the output is not a data frame. 
- See the [tabyl vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/janitor/vignettes/tabyls.html) for more information, adorn options, &amp; 3-way `tabyl`s

# Installing and using packages

- Packages are to R like apps are to your phone/OS
- Packages contain additional functions and data
- Install packages with `install.packages()`
  + Also can use the "Packages" tab in Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer window
  + *Only install once (unless you want to update)*
  + Installs from [Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/) = package mothership


```r
install.packages("dplyr")   # only do this ONCE, use quotes
```

- Load packages: At the top of your script include `library()` commands to load each required package *every* time you open Rstudio.

```r
library(dplyr)    # run this every time you open Rstudio
```

- Use a function without loading the package with `::`

```r
dplyr::arrange(mydata, bmi)
```

# Installing packages from other places (i.e. github, URLs)

- Need to have [remotes](https://github.com/r-lib/remotes#readme) package installed first:

```r
install.packages("remotes") 
```

- To install a package from github (often in development) use `install_github()` from the remotes package


```r
# https://github.com/hadley/yrbss
remotes::install_github("hadley/yrbss")

# Load it the same way
library(yrbss)
```

# How to get help (1/2)

Use `?` in front of function name in console. Try this:

![](img/01_help_screenshot.png)
---

# How to get help (2/2)

- Use `??` (i.e `??dplyr` or `??read_csv`) for searching all documentation in installed packages (including unloaded packages)
- search [Stack Overflow #r tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r)
- googlequestion + rcran or + r (i.e. "make a boxplot rcran" "make a boxplot r")
- google error in quotes (i.e. `"Evaluation error: invalid type (closure) for variable '***'"`)
- search [github](https://github.com/search/advanced?q=language:R) for your function name (to see examples) or error
- [Rstudio community](https://community.rstudio.com/)
- [twitter #rstats](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats&amp;src=typd)
